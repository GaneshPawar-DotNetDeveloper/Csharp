          Q. what is exception:
               exception is a unexcepted output/event or any unexcepted error at run time.
             
            * when there is unhandeled exception:
            *  1. code related information may get displayed to user cursor 
            *  2. Application will get terminate.
            
            - so we need to handle all exception.
          - we can handel the exception by
              try-catch block.
          i.try block:
             - write all code inside the try block.
             - try block should have atleast one catch or finally block.
         ii. catch-block:
             - whenever there is error in try block then catch block gets executed.
              - we can handle error here in catch block.
         iii. finally block:
              - this block does not handle exception.
              - finally block get  executed in all scenarios , when there is any error or when there 
                 is no error.
              - we can use finally block when we want to close any database connection or file connection
                  or service connection.
